        <h2 class="timeline-content-date">1991</h2>
        <p>There have been gay musicians hidden throughout rock music history, but Pansy Division when began in 1991 in San Francisco, they were the first to to be so boldly open about it.  Founded by guitarist/singer Jon Ginoli and soon joined by bassist/vocalist Chris Freeman, with the intent of forming a gay rock band, Pansy Division blew the closet doors open.

            Raised on a diet of 60s pop and 70s punk, their sound was suitably crunchy and catchy as hell. They wrote in-your-face lyrics, but did it with a sense of humor. Not only did their music and stance defy stereotypical norms of rock musicians being openly gay, they also broke gay cultural stereotypes that rock wouldn’t interest gay people. 
            
            With album titles like Undressed and Deflowered, and song titles like “Bill & Ted’s Homosexual Adventure,” their bluntness and humor stood out amidst the ’90s alterna-rock scene. Says Chris Freeman, “there was a lot of gay culture we couldn’t relate to, so we tried to invent a place for ourselves in it, an alternative for other queer misfits.” Having had the experience of being ostracized by other musicians for being gay and by other gays for being into rock, “we tried to turn our alienation into something positive,” says Ginoli. “Instead of being depressed about it, we tried to make music that would make us—and our audience—happy. We could laugh about it, so we put that joy into the music.”</p>

        <h2 class="timeline-content-date">1994</h2>
        <p>
            Their music caught the attention of former Lookout labelmates Green Day, who took Pansy Division on tour for a couple of months in 1994 at the height of the mania surrounding their breakthrough album Dookie. Says Ginoli, ”When we started our band we thought we’d be playing our music to people in their 20s & 30s who were gay or gay-friendly. Suddenly we faced thousands of high school kids each night, an amazing opportunity we never expected to have.” The response was decidedly mixed, but their popularity soared.

            Pansy Division toured and recorded almost non-stop during the 1990s, along the way recruiting a permanent drummer (Luis Illades) and a lead guitarist (first Patrick Goodwin, now Joel Reader).

        <p>
            1998’s Absurd Pop Song Romance was a departure from their earlier work, a more serious album both lyrically and sonically. The followup album Total Entertainment! (for a new label, Alternative Tentacles) found a happy medium between the broad humor of the early records and the more (dare we say it?) mature approach of the previous album.

        <h2 class="timeline-content-date">2009</h2>
        <p>In 2009 the band released That’s So Gay, both raucous and raunchy as well as being serious-minded.  With some of their catchiest and most rocking songs ever, they’re still loads of fun without being ironic or cynical.

From that album came the 7” single of “Average Men,” containing a new non-album track (a cover of a Green Day’s “Coming Clean”).  A documentary film about the band, Pansy Division: Life In A Gay Rock Band, played film festivals throughout 2008, and came out on DVD (with a bonus live DVD) at the same time. Also out in 2009 was Jon’s book Deflowered: My Life In Pansy Division, a memoir of Pansy Division stories and experiences. 

After that the band released two digital-only archival releases.  Lost Gems & Rare Tracks is exactly that, 14 songs from compilations, singles, and outtakes that never found their way onto a regular album.  Pansy Division Live 1992-2003 is a whopping 53-song double disc that comprehensively documents the many phases of Pansy Division’s sound.</p>
