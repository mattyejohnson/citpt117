          <li><em>June 21, 2020</em></li>
          <li>It will come as no surprise that we are not expecting to play any live shows the rest of this year. Despite having scheduled a number of shows throughout the year, the outlook is grim for live music. Some shows have not been formally cancelled, but it’s highly unlikely they will occur, and we have removed them from our Upcoming Shows list.</li>
          <li>The show we most looked forward to was our appearance at the Burger Boogaloo, where we to open for Bikini Kill. It was supposed to happen in July, then was rescheduled for Halloween weekend, and has now been pushed back to July 2021. They have also renamed it BB 11, to reflect the word “boogaloo” being hijacked by white supremacist extremists.</li>
          <li>We’re glad we made it to our Texas shows right before the pandemic hit, and look forward to whenever it is we can safely perform live again.</li>

          <li><em>April 6, 2020</em></li>
          <li>We have 2 songs on I Wanna Be Well, a digital compilation of 17 live tracks taken from last year’s Punk Rock Raduno Festival in Bergamo, Italy, also including The Avengers and other great bands.</li>
          <li>Bergamo has been hit very hard during the Coronavirus crisis, and the folks who put on the festival have created this comp to raise money for hospitals in Bergamo. You can hear us doing live versions of “He Whipped My Ass in Tennis (Then I Fucked His Ass in Bed)” and our cover of Green Day’s “Coming Clean.”</li>

          <li>Back in 1997 we released our “Manada” single on Vancouver B.C. label Mint Records, with the B-side “Hockey Hair.” Both songs appeared on our album More Lovin’ From Our Oven later that year, and “Hockey Hair” was included on the Canadian compilation Johnny Hanson Presents Puck Rock Vol. 2 in 1999.</li>

          <li><em>March 8, 2020</em></li>
          <li>Streaming on Showtime Now is a new queer series called Work In Progress, starring Abby McEnamy. They used our song “Luv Luv Luv” in Episode 3.</li>
          <li><img src = "img/work_in_progress.jpg" alt = "Work In Progress Netflix" width = "430"></li>
          <li>The show features “a 45-year-old self-identified fat, queer dyke whose misfortune and despair unexpectedly lead her to a vibrantly transformative relationship. Chicago improv mainstay Abby McEnany co-created and stars in this uniquely human comedy series.”</li>
          <li>Our involvement happened very suddenly and we still haven’t seen yet the show. But several people have mentioned to us that they heard and the song and like the show, so we will.</li>

          <li><em>November 30, 2020</em></li>
          <li>You may have noticed, on Spotify and Apple Music and other music streaming sites, that there is a new Pansy Division release. Singles & Such collects original songs that had been released on Pileup, More Lovin’ From From Our Oven, as well as other songs from singles and compilations. We left off the covers for various reasons, wanting to get our original songs which had not previously been on the streaming platforms out there and circulating.      </li>
          <li><img src = "img/PD_singles.jpg" alt = "Record" width = "430"></li>
          <li>We also included one cover, our version of the Stooges’ “Loose,” which had appeared on the late ’90s Stooges tribute CD We Will Fall, because it’s one of our best covers and was never on one of our albums. There is no CD or LP release, it’s a digital-only release.</li>
          <li>Here’s the track listing:<br />
            1. Fuck Buddy<br />
            2. Ring of Joy<br />
            3. Bill & Ted’s Homosexual Adventure<br />
            4. Touch My Joe Camel<br />
