                                    I met him at a party <br />
                                    We bonded right away <br />
                                    It was obvious <br />
                                    The attraction was 2-way <br />
                                    <br />
                                    He said he lived on a boat, but there was a fire<br />
                                    So he’s surfing sofas for a little while<br />
                                    I gave him my number but he lost his phone <br />
                                    His message was clear as a dial tone <br />
                                    <br />
                                    He’s trouble (T-R-O-U-B-L-E) <br />
                                    He’s trouble (T-R-O-U-B-L-E) <br />
                                    Trouble with a capital T, T-R-O-U-B-L-E <br />
                                    <br />
                                    He wants to model again <br />
                                    When he loses 10 pounds <br />
                                    But the 40s he drinks in the park <br />
                                    Are weighing him down <br />    
                                    <br />
                                    He’s always wearing the same old hat <br />
                                    His hair is receding, he’s touchy bout that <br />
                                    He’s always broke but always has a drink <br />
                                    Add it up it’s hard not to think… <br />
                                    <br />
                                    (repeat chorus)<br />
                                    <br />
                                    It’s one disappointment after another <br />
                                    It’s always some excuse about something or other <br />
                                    Gave him the benefit of the doubt <br />
                                    But soon your patience just runs out <br />
                                    <br />
                                    (repeat chorus) <br />
                                    <br />
                                    He’s trouble, he’s trouble, he’s trouble… <br />

                                    I once wrote a song about being a slut <br />
                                    Nothing meant more to me than busting a nut <br />
                                    Now I’ve grown older and that life ain’t making the cut <br />
                                    I’m willing to follow my gut and admit I was wrong <br />
                                    Because love came along <br />
                                    <br />
                                    I had it easy and sex was so easy to get <br />
                                    I had no problem with fucking someone I’d just met <br />
                                    I’ve had some nights that I’m sure I will never forget <br />
                                    But now all the rules have reset because love came along <br />
                                    Because love came along <br />
                                    <br />
                                    For me, life was fancy and free <br />
                                    And I’d give it up for a man if he fancied me<br />
                                    You see, sex was all quantity<br />
                                    And with hundreds of men in my wake I think you’ll agree that<br />
                                    <br />
                                    There’s not a thing wrong with being a slut<br />
                                    Except for the part where I’ve hit a rut<br />
                                    And now that I’m older the question at hand is “so what?”<br />
                                    I’m willing to follow my gut even if I am wrong <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Because love came along <br />
                                    I was so easy, had sex with whomever I met <br />
                                    I had no problem avoiding diseases and yet <br />
                                    I woke up sometimes with some guys that I really regret <br />
                                    But now all the rules have reset because love came along <br />
                                    Because love came along <br />
                                    <br />
                                    For me, life is fancy and free <br />
                                    And I give it up for one man who has taken me<br />
                                    You see, no man’s better than he<br />
                                    And with hundreds of men in my wake I can judge easily and<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Now all the rules have reset because love came along<br />
                                    I never wake up with regret now that love came along<br />
                                    I’m only a slut for my man now that love came along<br />
                                    Only busting a nut in one man now that love came along<br />
                                    I’m the happiest guy in the world now that love came along<br />
                                    I know you’ll grow tired of hearing it so I’m ending this song<br />

                                        And spent a thousand nights alone just screening my calls <br />
                                        But now the phone is singing your song <br />
                                        The ringing is the sound I had missed all along <br />
                                        The sweetest sound I’ve ever known <br />

                                        When I look up sending a text<br />

                                        We’re side by side but all alone<br />

                                        Congratulations: you’ve made it this far<br />  
                                        Not much of a future the way that things are<br />  
                                        No job, no money, and worse of all, no plan<br />  
                                        <br />
                                        Don’t have much to speak of, not even a car<br />  
                                        I used to have to come and pick you up after closing time at the bar<br />  
                                        I thought by now you would’ve had enough, living life like Peter Pan<br />  
                                        <br />
                                        Because you’re halfway to nowhere<br />  
                                        And you’re running out of time<br />  
                                        <br />
                                        I’m going to be frank with you ‘cause if I don’t who will<br />  
                                        Since I left you’ve spent a lot of time going farther down that hill<br />  
                                        I won’t be there to catch you and it’s not that I don’t care<br />  
                                        Because you’re halfway to nowhere<br />  
                                        And you’re running out of time<br />

                                        <br />
                                        I wish we could be closer but you know that I don’t dare<br />

                                        The focus always somewhere else<br />
                                        On the edges, on the fringe<br />
                                        On the outside looking in<br />
                                        Wary of the final score<br />
                                        But always hold out hope for more<br />

                                        He’s a politician with a love of the lord<br />
                                        He’s getting kickbacks from his seat on the church board<br />
                                        He voted no, of course, on your civil rights<br />
                                        And if he gets elected he’d reverse that, all right<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Your basic needs are not his priority<br />
                                        He’s got his reputation to oversee<br />
                                        So if you’re gay or if you just don’t fit in<br />
                                        He’ll introduce you to the wages of sin<br />

                                        And wants to scare you straight<br />
                                        He’s redesigned the Bible’s libel<br />
                                        To justify his hate<br />
                                        When asked if there’s a woman, he’d rather not say<br />
                                        And what about this asshole caught with kiddie porn?<br />
                                        He’s funneling funds through churches “to protect the unborn”<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I can’t believe, I can’t believe what they say<br />
                                        They’ll say anything to get their own way<br />
                                        They have no limits, they’ll just blatantly lie<br />
                                        In the name of Jesus it’s all justified<br />
                                        <br />
                                        They’re quoting all the Bible’s libel<br />
                                        The ones that suit their needs<br />
                                        Promoting all the Bible’s libel<br />
                                        With words but not their deeds<br />
                                        What’s written in the Bible is libel<br />
                                        No matter what you’ve heard<br />
                                        We’re sick of all the Bible’s libel<br />
                                        So don’t believe a word<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Do you want him for your president? NO<br />
                                        Do you want him for your president? NO<br />
                                        Do you want her for your president? NO<br /> 
                                        Do you want him for your president? HELL NO<br />

                                        <br />
                                        We don’t need the Bible, Bible<br />
                                        So throw it all away<br />
                                        Yeah, we don’t heed the Bible, Bible<br />
                                        Any-fucking-way<br />
                                        What’s written in the Bible is libel<br />
                                        But slanders you and me<br />
                                        So spit into the Bible, Bible<br />
                                        And just be free<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Isn’t it about time we gave up on Christianity?<br />
                                        I mean really, it’s so unnecessary and so deceitful.<br />
                                        Using verses from the Bible to validate their hate<br />
                                        Just look at all the damage they’ve caused.<br />
                                        So let’s take away the one thing they use to perpetuate this worldwide fraud<br />
                                        And tear up the Bible<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Can you tell the difference between any of those other religions? HELL NO<br />
                                        Do we really need any of them anymore? HELL NO<br />

                                        My phone just don’t ring like it used to<br />
                                        Some of my best friends are dead<br />
                                        And the most exciting thing in my evening<br />
                                        Is a hot cup of tea before bed<br />
                                        I’ve got more aches and pains than I used to<br />
                                        And now I’ll avoid a big crowd<br />
                                        I hate the suggestion but there is a question<br />
                                        I find myself asking out loud<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Is this what it’s like, is this what it’s like<br />
                                        Is this what it’s like getting old?<br />
                                        I cherish each day and each roll in the hay<br />
                                        Is this what it’s like getting old?<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Please do not think I’m complaining<br />
                                        I’m merely presenting the facts<br />
                                        And while I am at it, I might as well add<br />
                                        It takes three drinks a day to relax<br />
                                        I never expected to be here<br />
                                        Or thought I would end up like this<br />
                                        So allow me to ponder this question, I wonder<br />
                                        What’s happened to years that I’ve missed?<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Is this what it’s like, is this what it’s like<br />
                                        Is this what it’s like getting old?<br />
                                        I don’t want no sympathy, but my mind ain’t what it used to be<br />
                                        Is this what it’s like getting old?<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Is this what it’s like, is this what it’s like<br />
                                        Is this what it’s like getting old?<br />
                                        It takes longer, you’ll see, now I sit down to pee<br />
                                        Is this what it’s like getting old?<br />

                                        After so many letdowns<br />
                                        The bar is set so low<br />

                                        To simply so show up<br />
                                        At a time and date that’s set<br />
                                        To merely keep your word<br />
                                        Is that too hard a task?<br />
                                        Are all of these simple things<br />
                                        Just too much to ask?<br />

                                        Why do gay men treat each other so badly?<br />

                                        Now I’m gonna fold it<br />
                                        Another guy who doesn’t show up<br />

                                        To say something to make things right<br />
                                        But you’re not listening anyway<br />
                                        When sadness turns to anger<br />
                                        Resentment’s coming next<br />
                                        After dumping me the way you did<br />
                                        What did you expect?<br />

                                        We had something beautiful,<br />
                                        For a long, long time<br />
                                        <br />
                                        One day you sat me down to talk<br />
                                        But your reasons made no sense<br />
                                        6 months of holding in your feelings<br />
                                        Came at my expense<br />
                                        Can’t believe, still can’t believe<br />
                                        How many months have passed<br />
                                        Can’t believe that you and me<br />
                                        Are now part of the past<br />
                                        <br />
                                        But we had something beautiful,<br />
                                        We had something beautiful,<br />
                                        We had something beautiful,<br />
                                        And you threw it all away<br />
                                        <br />
                                        People walk into your life<br />
                                        Sharing something deep and strong<br />
                                        But just as quickly disappear<br />
                                        They leave, forever gone<br />
                                        So don’t wait for that phone to ring<br />
                                        The silence is too loud<br />
                                        Get used to the idea<br />
                                        People always let you down<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I felt so comfortable with you<br />
                                        I could really be myself<br />
                                        Even though you broke things off<br />
                                        It still felt like success<br />
                                        <br />
                                        ‘Cause we had something beautiful,<br />
                                        We had something beautiful,<br />

                                        And you had something beautiful<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Yeah we had something beautiful,<br />
