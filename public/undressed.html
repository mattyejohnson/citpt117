                                    There’s a few straight guys I know<br />
                                    They wanna know who plays the women’s role<br />
                                    I shake my head and say it’s not like that<br />
                                    Some guys have the imagination of a doormat<br />
                                    Our roles are not cast in stone<br />
                                    We trade off getting boned<br />
                                    Cause we’re versatile<br />
                                    <br />
                                    There’s a few straight guys I’ve known<br />
                                    There’s a few straight guys I’ve blown<br />
                                    They like women and make sure you don’t forget it<br />
                                    But they’ve got a burning desire to get it<br />
                                    They want to know how taking it feels<br />
                                    Like Pete Townshend when he revealed<br />
                                    He’s versatile <br />
                                    <br />
                                    There’s a few straight guys I know<br />
                                    Tired of the traditional roles<br />
                                    There’s nothing like a good vibrator<br />
                                    To jump start a bored masturbator<br />
                                    Maybe a dildo would enrich their lives<br />
                                    They could explain to their girlfriends and wives<br />
                                    They’re versatile<br />

                                    I don’t like macho, put it away<br />
                                    Doesn’t appeal to me straight or gay<br />
                                    But I know a boy who catches my eye,<br />
                                    He don’t act tough, why should he try?<br />

                                    Cute little butt and sexy hips<br />
                                    The way he moves has me inspired<br />
                                    He’s the boy that I require<br />
                                    <br />

                                    He looks as good in a skirt as he does in jeans<br />
                                    He is a most notorious queen<br />
                                    (With) his personality I’m not impressed<br />
                                    But I can’t wait to get him undressed<br />
                                    <br />

                                        I’ve never been in anything like this before<br />
                                        We take off our clothes before we’re in the door<br />
                                        Eight hours of work is especially tough<br />
                                        When three times a day is barely enough<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I got the carrot, you got the stick<br />
                                        You start to nibble, I start to lick<br />
                                        And we get our bodies all hot and sweaty and runny<br />
                                        And then we fuck like bunnies<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Showing up early catches me off guard<br />
                                        Hearing your knock on y door gets me hard<br />
                                        You drive me rough like a pick-up truck<br />
                                        It’s a never-ending, non-stop boy fuck<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I got the carrot, you got the stick<br />
                                        You start to nibble, I start to lick<br />
                                        And we get our bodies all hot and sweaty and runny<br />
                                        And then we fuck like bunnies<br />
                                        <br />
                                        It’s been days and days since I’ve seen my friends<br />
                                        Burning the candle with you at both ends<br />
                                        We might burn out like a supernova<br />
                                        But for the moment please roll over<br />
                                        <br />

                                        They come onto you so bold<br />
                                        You get them home, they pass out cold<br />
                                        They go to sleep you start to snore<br />
                                        I can’t put up with this anymore<br />

                                        Waited so long, how much more to go?<br />

                                        Frustrated, sitting at home<br />
                                        Life’s too short to spend alone<br />
                                        You throw some clothes on that tired body<br />
                                        Venture out and try to meet somebody<br />
                                        But it’s a temporary gain,<br />
                                        To tide you over and keep you from going insane<br />

                                        That’s not where my life is heading<br />
                                        O drunken squalor, get thee behind me<br />
                                        But there’s always some old trick there to remind me<br />
                                        I’m professionally single, you know<br />
                                        I’m so experienced that by now I’m a pro<br />
                                        No no no, no no no…<br />
                                        No no no, no no no…<br />
                                        No no no, no no no…<br />
                                        Waited so long, how much more to go?<br />

                                        I met a cute guy in a gallery<br />
                                        I looked at him he smiled at me<br />
                                        We started talking and I was impressed<br />
                                        He was smart and sweet and confident<br />
                                        Just as I was thanking my good luck<br />
                                        That was the moment reality struck<br />
                                        He bid me goodbye and quickly fled<br />
                                        Back to the safety of his girlfriend <br />
                                        <br />
                                        And that’s the story so far<br />
                                        That’s the story so far <br />
                                        <br />
                                        Well I was hangin’ out at that old queer bar<br />
                                        The only in my home town<br />
                                        Looking around, didn’t find much to choose<br />
                                        Feeling the I-can’t-get-laid blues<br />
                                        But as I was leaving the doorman smiled<br />
                                        He was a honey so I stopped for a while<br />
                                        We hit it off, but oh, cruel fate <br />
                                        He was the only guy in the place that was straight <br />
                                        <br />
                                        And that’s the story so far<br />
                                        That’s the story so far <br />
                                        <br />
                                        This is the part that I can’t stand<br />
                                        Falling for an attractive man<br />
                                        Who’s great but often straight<br />
                                        This is the part I hate<br />
                                        But one I ten still means a lot of them<br />
                                        But so many are wrapped up in silly trends<br />
                                        That I despise and make me roll my eyes<br />
                                        Is this my community?<br />
                                        Sometimes I want to mutiny <br />
                                        <br />
                                        Walking down the street<br />
                                        So many guys I want to meet<br />
                                        And it makes me smile<br />
                                        But it might take a long while<br />
                                        To find that cutie<br />
                                        With both brains and beauty<br />
                                        So I’ll keep the faith<br />
                                        But for now I wait <br />
                                        <br />
                                        And that’s the story, that’s the story, that’s the story of my life<br />
                                        That’s the story, that’s the story, that’s the story of my life<br />
                                        That’s the story, that’s the story, that’s the story so far<br />

                                        He’s tall and slim<br />

                                        He’s a foxy dude<br />
                                        I’d love to lure him to my room<br />
                                        We’ll lay back, relax and do some shrooms<br />
                                        <br />

                                        Are made in El Salvador<br />
                                        If I could get inside them<br />
                                        I’d be a happy man for sure<br />
                                        I realize many guys like this aren’t gay<br />
                                        But there’s so much ambiguity<br />
                                        I wouldn’t try to say <br />
                                        <br />

                                        Maybe I could learn<br />
                                        To stand the Grateful Dead<br />
                                        It sure beats listening<br />
                                        To some dance remix instead<br />
                                        I’d love to run my hand<br />
                                        Through his long and wavy locks<br />
                                        And be stretched out on his bed<br />
                                        Holding one another’s cocks <br />

                                        And make them into something real<br />
                                        And finally do all the things he’s been dreaming of<br />
                                        He’s joining the cocksucker club<br />
                                        <br />
                                        To not have to pretend he was drunk<br />
                                        When he seduced his roommate on his bunk<br />
                                        He might be bi, he might be gay<br />
                                        But he knows he’s finally ready to say<br />
                                        Some of the things he’s constantly thinking of<br />
                                        He’s joining the cocksucker club<br />
                                        <br />
                                        So lick lick lick, suck suck suck<br />
                                        Unroll the condoms and fuck fuck fuck<br />
                                        Down on your knees giving good head<br />
                                        Do it on your parents’ queen-size bed<br />
                                        <br />
                                        In high school he spent hundred if hours<br />
                                        Fantasizing about boys in the showers<br />
                                        Billy was hung, Rick was thick<br />
                                        Daniel had a most upstanding dick<br />
                                        But Eric was the one with extra yardage to love<br />
                                        By joining the cocksucker club<br />
                                        <br />
                                        So lick lick lick, slurp slurp slurp<br />
                                        Do it though your jaws start to hurt<br />
                                        The taste and feel of a dick that’s new<br />
                                        Is a fun activity to pursue<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He’s though about it for a long, long time<br />
                                        About being attracted to his own kind<br />
                                        He’s ready to face what it means<br />
                                        When another boy causes a lump in your jeans<br />
                                        Taking the plunge, going down for love<br />
                                        He’s joining the cocksucker club<br />
                                        He’s ready for the cocksucker club<br />
                                        He’s a member of the cocksucker club<br />

                                        I knew when I first met him<br />
                                        That I never would forget him<br />
                                        To find a beauty such as he in my bed was rare<br />
                                        To sleep with him I was excited<br />
                                        But later I was less delighted<br />
                                        When I found that special present he left in my pubic hair <br />
                                        <br />
                                        Now it’s a crabby day, unhappy day<br />
                                        I’ll never forget him I’m sad to say<br />
                                        Leave me alone<br />
                                        I’m having a crabby day<br />
                                        <br />
                                        So to the drugstore without haste<br />
                                        To solve the problem below the waist<br />
                                        Then the laundromat to disinfect my clothes and sheets<br />
                                        Walking home who do I see<br />
                                        But the guy who gave those wretched vermin to me<br />
                                        He quickly runs to opposite side of the street<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Now it’s a crabby day, unhappy day<br />
                                        To be treated in such a shabby way<br />
                                        Give me a break,<br />
                                        I’m having a crabby day<br />
                                        <br />
                                        At home a message is waiting<br />
                                        From a boy I’ve been contemplating<br />
                                        He’s leaving town for a month and wants to see me tonight<br />
                                        After the lotion’s been applied<br />
                                        Can I be sure every one of those critters has died?<br />
                                        Or take the risk of passing them on for a long-awaited night?<br />
                                        <br />
                                        It’s such a crabby day, unhappy day<br />
                                        Why did he have to call today?<br />
                                        Get me out of this<br />
                                        I’m having a crabby day<br />

                                        Once slept with a black-haired lad<br />
                                        Went up his apartment<br />
                                        Pretty quickly, things turned bad<br />
                                        Passion wasn’t his department<br />
                                        Too busy shoving poppers up his nose to notice me<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Took a chance with another<br />
                                        Frolicking in bed<br />
                                        But he couldn’t get exited<br />
                                        Unless I help a pillow tightly over his head<br />
                                        Just your average boy next door<br />
                                        Well they say some day prince will come<br />
                                        Not holding my breath anymore<br />
                                        <br />
                                        You gotta kiss some frogs<br />
                                        Well I’ve heard that one before<br />
                                        Now I’ve kissed a lot of frogs<br />
                                        Am I better off than I was before<br />
                                        Sitting here alone chapped lips<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I’ve never been a slut<br />
                                        Though I’ve slept with more than a few<br />
                                        Maybe that’s something that<br />
                                        I could aspire to<br />
                                        There’s a lot of people in this town<br />
                                        Who never seem to come to grips with<br />
                                        How they feel from the waist down<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Well I’ve been reading the personals<br />
                                        There seems to be two kinds<br />
                                        Helpless romantics<br />
                                        Or guys with absolutely nothing on their minds<br />
                                        But the endless bump and grind<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Living in a fishbowl<br />
                                        Here at the edge of the world<br />
                                        You can’t go west forever<br />
                                        Or you’ll hit ocean bottom<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Looking up from the Golden Gate<br />
                                        I can’t see east of the Berkeley Hills<br />
                                        But some people wanna live in North Dakota<br />
                                        Maybe you can go far in Fargo<br />

                                        Touch your knee, slide up your leg<br />
                                        Pull your shirt off over your head<br />

                                        And surrender our clothing to the floor<br />
                                        <br />

                                        Kiss your neck, fingers through your hair<br />
                                        Reaching down your back inside your underwear<br />
                                        Feel your tongue, feel your lips<br />
                                        Bodies in motion, grinding hips<br />
                                        All hands below, finding what’s concealed<br />
                                        Zippers down, the prize revealed<br />

                                        We can’t relate to Judy Garland<br />
                                        It’s a new generation of music calling<br />
                                        <br />
                                        We’re the buttfuckers of rock & roll<br />
                                        We want to sock it to your hole<br />
                                        With loud guitars, we’re gay and proud<br />

                                        They won’t risk their careers to come out to you<br />
                                        We have no such deceptions, no such ploys<br />
                                        We make it clear we want to sleep with boys<br />

                                        We don’t care if you’re top or bottom<br />
                                        Just use your butthole, everyone’s got ‘em<br />
                                        <br />
                                        We do love rock & roll, it’s true<br />
                                        But that boy meets girl stuff just won’t do<br />
                                        We got our condoms, we got our lube<br />
                                        We know how to use ‘em, how ‘bout you?<br />
