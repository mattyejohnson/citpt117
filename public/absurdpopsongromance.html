                                    It’s hard enough to wake up<br />
                                    Every day of my life<br />
                                    But today it’s even<br />
                                    Harder than before<br />
                                    Cuz I don’t know what I’m doing<br />
                                    At this place, at this time<br />
                                    And I don’t know how I got here<br />
                                    That’s for sure<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Year after year it’s getting clear<br />
                                    They’re flying by, I know<br />
                                    Day after day they speed away<br />
                                    I wonder where they go<br />
                                    <br />

                                    Between the days of my life<br />
                                    Just when you think you’re fine<br />
                                    You’ve hit the floor<br />
                                    And when someone says you’re looking great<br />
                                    They’re telling you lies<br />
                                    You look older than<br />
                                    You ever did before<br />
                                    <br />

                                        It was in the spring<br />
                                        When we first met<br />
                                        The time of year when young men’s thoughts<br />
                                        Turn to other men<br />
                                        So young and romantic<br />
                                        But hopelessly naive<br />
                                        When you said I was perfect<br />
                                        I didn’t know just what to believe<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I’m glad we had our time<br />
                                        But glad to see it end<br />
                                        Don’t you think that maybe we’d be<br />
                                        Better off just friends<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Your pre-conceptions<br />
                                        Drove me half mad<br />
                                        I couldn’t be your standard issue<br />
                                        Regulation fag<br />
                                        The things that you found trivial<br />
                                        Meant everything to me<br />
                                        Oh what a lovely love affair<br />
                                        All we did was disagree<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I’m glad we had our time<br />
                                        But glad to see it end<br />

                                        You still haven’t learned<br />
                                        What I found out real quick<br />
                                        No use trying to drag things out<br />
                                        When you know we just didn’t click<br />
                                        So here we are again<br />
                                        And I don’t mean to be unkind<br />
                                        But to get back together<br />
                                        I’d have to be out of my mind<br />
                                        You call me once again<br />
                                        To tell you’re fine<br />
                                        Then proceed to do nothing<br />
                                        But bitch and moan and whine<br />

                                        I see your face<br />
                                        Torture never felt so great<br />
                                        But still I turn away<br />

                                        I’d be fine<br />
                                        If we’d never met<br />

                                        I’d never have a chance to get<br />
                                        But I don’t know what to do<br />
                                        Cause you’re too beautiful<br />
                                        <br />
                                        For years I wondered what it would be like<br />
                                        To have someone as wonderful as you<br />
                                        In my life<br />
                                        But if friends is all that we’ll ever be<br />
                                        That’s not enough for me<br />
                                        <br />
                                        My heart easily breaks<br />

                                        Repeating all the same mistakes<br />
                                        So I won’t be friends with you<br />
                                        Cause you’re too beautiful<br />
                                        You’re just too beautiful<br />

                                        Come face to face with gloom<br />
                                        More sorrow on the way<br />
                                        Ruining another day<br />
                                        It doesn’t get you anywhere<br />
                                        To wallow in your own despair<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Cause happiness is the best revenge<br />

                                        <br />
                                        My father punched the clock<br />
                                        Raised his kids like another job<br />
                                        Did well financially<br />
                                        But so remote emotionally<br />
                                        Let it go, it’s so far gone<br />
                                        Malignant if it lingers on<br />
                                        <br />

                                        You’re a victim you complain<br />
                                        You won first prize for pain<br />
                                        You wave your trophy high<br />
                                        At everyone who passes by<br />
                                        Some people can’t bear to see<br />
                                        You living happily<br />
                                        Had you guilt tripped for years<br />
                                        So much invested in those tears<br />
                                        I know my life would be so nice<br />
                                        If I could follow my own advice<br />
                                        <br />

                                        I thought I’d know what to do<br />
                                        You thought I’d know it too<br />
                                        I was a bad boyfriend<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Thought I knew what I was in for<br />
                                        Turned out to be a whole lot more<br />
                                        I was a bad boyfriend<br />
                                        <br />
                                        There’s give, and there is take<br />
                                        I chose the wrong one by mistake<br />
                                        I was a bad boyfriend<br />
                                        <br />
                                        It was about things big and small<br />
                                        You couldn’t comprehend at all<br />
                                        About how you got involved<br />
                                        With a guy with that much gall<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Thought I’d learn from my mistakes<br />
                                        Didn’t know how many I’d make<br />
                                        I was a bad boyfriend<br />
                                        <br />
                                        So easy to blame someone else<br />
                                        Hard to point the finger at yourself<br />
                                        I was a bad boyfriend<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I’m afraid I agree with you<br />
                                        Give myself a scathing review<br />
                                        I was a bad boyfriend<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Guess I was happier on my own<br />
                                        Guess I was worried about being alone<br />
                                        Condescending in my tone<br />
                                        I was flexible as a stone<br />
                                        <br />
                                        You shot me a withering glance<br />
                                        When I asked for another chance<br />
                                        I was a bad boyfriend<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I’m sad to see you go<br />
                                        But I fucked it up, I know<br />
                                        I was a bad boyfriend<br />
                                        Bad boyfriend…<br />

                                        When he lets you down<br />

                                        For letting all your friendships wither away<br />

                                        Where you seem to be bound<br />

                                        Waiting in a restaurant<br />
                                        Sitting at the bar<br />
                                        A glance at the label<br />
                                        On the back of a mustard jar<br />
                                        Suddenly a memory<br />
                                        Springs to life again<br />
                                        The name of the town<br />
                                        Of a long forgotten flame<br />

                                        Flashback in an instant<br />
                                        To a boy who grow up there<br />
                                        We met while escaping<br />
                                        The stale suburban air<br />
                                        Our friendship blossomed<br />
                                        Then stopped in its tracks<br />
                                        One mention of his hometown<br />
                                        And it all comes flooding back<br />
                                        From Glenview<br />
                                        <br />
                                        It hits you like it’s yesterday<br />
                                        It hits you by surprise<br />
                                        It hits you so completely<br />
                                        It brings tears to your eye<br />
                                        And I wonder if I miss him<br />
                                        Or just miss the way I felt<br />
                                        That pure and noble feeling<br />
                                        When there’s just nobody else<br />
                                        <br />
                                        After graduation<br />
                                        We didn’t stay in touch<br />
                                        To try to keep in contact<br />
                                        Would have hurt too much<br />
                                        He knew how much I loved him<br />
                                        And he once gave me a kiss<br />
                                        He said “I wish you all the luck<br />
                                        In finding your prince…”<br />

                                        In the video store<br />
                                        On my way home<br />
                                        Flipped to the gay porn<br />
                                        When my mind was blown<br />
                                        A blast from my past<br />
                                        Could it really be<br />
                                        The high school boy<br />
                                        Who tormented me<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He was a vicious beauty<br />
                                        He had it and he knew<br />
                                        That he was top of the heap<br />
                                        Looking down on you<br />
                                        <br />
                                        So graceful<br />
                                        Athletic too<br />
                                        But so conceited<br />
                                        Too good for you<br />
                                        He was the one<br />
                                        I loved to hate<br />
                                        And the one I hated that I loved<br />
                                        Make no mistake<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He was a vicious beauty<br />
                                        He had it and he knew<br />
                                        That he was top of the heap<br />
                                        Looking down on you<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Years have passed but I recall<br />
                                        His arrogant glare<br />
                                        I’d know that body and that look<br />
                                        Anywhere<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Swallowed up by the VCR<br />
                                        It was him alright<br />
                                        Coming at me long and hard<br />
                                        Here was my fantasy<br />
                                        Of him in the buff<br />
                                        Even though I got erect<br />
                                        I pressed eject<br />
                                        I’d seen enough<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He was a vicious beauty<br />
                                        Such a vicious beauty<br />
                                        <br />
                                        To see him with another guy<br />
                                        Doing things I fantasized<br />
                                        Feeling vindicated<br />
                                        Bummed out and elated<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He was a vicious beauty<br />
                                        Such a vicious beauty<br />
