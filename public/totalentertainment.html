                                    He’s into sports, looks good in shorts<br />
                                    But you’re just another game to him<br />
                                    I’ve seen his type, seen ’em all my life<br />
                                    Always pulling for the side that’s winning<br />
                                    <br />
                                    You need someone who cares<br />
                                    So don’t look over there<br />
                                    I can show you what you’ve been missing<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Who treats you right? I do baby<br />
                                    Who treats you right? I do baby<br />
                                    Who treats you right? I do baby,<br />
                                    I do babe, who treats you right!<br />

                                    For so many guys, he is quite a prize<br />
                                    But he requires constant attention<br />
                                    If you reel him in, he’ll wiggle free again<br />
                                    Then treat you with condescension<br />
                                    <br />
                                    You waste your time with jerks<br />
                                    And when it doesn’t work<br />
                                    You know it’s me you always turn to<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Who treats you right? I do baby<br />
                                    Who treats you right? I do baby<br />
                                    Who treats you right? I do baby,<br />
                                    I do babe, who treats you right!<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Yeah he’s been working out<br />
                                    But what will you talk about<br />
                                    Over coffee in the early morning?<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Who treats you right? I do baby<br />

                                    Who treats you right? I do baby,<br />

                                        But now you feel guilty<br />
                                        Questioning everything<br />
                                        You have with him<br />
                                        It’s a major dilemma<br />
                                        When you risk it all on a whim<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Cuz while he’s been gone<br />
                                        We’ve been getting it on<br />
                                        While he waits so long<br />
                                        To be in your arms where he belongs<br />
                                        <br />
                                        When he comes home<br />
                                        Wait till he’s unwound,<br />
                                        Then sit him right down and talk<br />
                                        Tell him everything,<br />
                                        Don’t hold back a thing at all<br />

                                        But anyhow, you took the vow<br />
                                        So be responsible for that now<br />
                                        <br />

                                        Don’t you wait too long<br />
                                        Or he’ll hear it form someone else<br />
                                        <br />
                                        When he comes home<br />

                                        And he’d never take the chance you took today<br />
                                        I know you’re good with him<br />

                                        Mama said play hard to get<br />
                                        Mama might have had something there<br />
                                        I make the effort, I make the time<br />
                                        But I doubt you’ll ever be mine<br />

                                        You put up so many barriers<br />
                                        I get more calls from long-distance carriers<br />

                                        Now I’ve met every one of them<br />
                                        It isn’t them I’m trying to date<br />

                                        You offer kneepads, but I’m not gonna crawl<br />
                                        It’s like playing tennis with a basketball<br />

                                        I’m fine wine and you’re Boone’s Farm<br />
                                        You’re really good at stringing me along<br />

                                        If I’m so damn smart<br />
                                        Things I can’t control<br />

                                        Wow, how cute, what a guy<br />
                                        The kind that makes my mouth go dry<br />
                                        He turned around and flashed me a smile<br />
                                        While I pictured us walking down the aisle<br />
                                        My better judgment took a holiday<br />
                                        All I needed was to hear him say<br />
                                        That he yearned for a deeper connection<br />
                                        His lips parted, out popped a confession, he said<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Oh, oh, oh, I want you<br />
                                        Oh, oh, oh, I want you<br />
                                        Oh oh, I want you with no protection<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Wow, how could I argue with that?<br />
                                        He’d gotten me in seconds flat<br />
                                        So open and trusting too<br />
                                        I took him home, I was long overdue<br />
                                        We shed our clothes as he shut the door<br />
                                        And I opened up the bottom drawer<br />
                                        Female condoms, my predilection<br />
                                        But when he saw my selection, he said<br />
                                        <br />
                                        No, no, no, I want you<br />
                                        No, no, no, I want you<br />
                                        No no, I want you with no protection<br />
                                        <br />
                                        How could I miss what he meant?<br />
                                        He suddenly seemed less intelligent<br />
                                        He said “If it’s not spit, then it’s not love<br />
                                        So put away those penile gloves,” and I said<br />
                                        No, no, no, this won’t do<br />
                                        And I lost my erection<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Now listen to me!<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Oh, oh, oh, I want you<br />

                                        And a guy on your right<br />

                                    <br />
                                    If you believe<br />
                                    This is how things ought to be<br />
                                    Just repeat after me<br />
                                    Total entertainment, total entertainment…<br />

                                    (CHORUS:) At the mall, at the mall, ah-oo, ah-oo<br />
                                    At the mall, at the mall, ah-oo, ah-oo<br />
                                    <br />
                                    1. At the mall is where I want to be<br />
                                    A place where they have everything I need<br />
                                    I love the way their fountains always pour<br />
                                    And the way that they get trees to grow indoors<br />
                                    <br />
                                    (REPEAT CHORUS)<br />
                                    <br />
                                    2. You could see a movie right next door<br />
                                    Where there used to be one screen, now there’s 24<br />
                                    No X-rated, NC-17<br />
                                    The mall is nothing if not safe and clean<br />
                                    <br />
                                    (REPEAT CHORUS)<br />
                                    <br />
                                    3. At the mall there’s no gay bars or porn<br />
                                    A place where polyester’s often worn<br />
                                    I hope I find an easy parking spot<br />
                                    Or I might be forced to walk 2 blocks<br />
                                    <br />
                                    (REPEAT CHORUS)<br />
                                    <br />
                                    4. Teenage girls hang out and looks for males<br />
                                    When they get bored, they head in for the sales<br />
                                    Power walkers get their exercise<br />
                                    And diet pills to shrink their thunder thighs<br />
                                    <br />
                                    (REPEAT CHORUS)<br />
                                    <br />
                                    5. At the mall they don’t sell drugs or booze<br />
                                    But there’s 50 different places to buy shoes<br />
                                    My walkman plays the CDs that I bought<br />
                                    Cause anything I want, Sam Goody’s got<br />
                                    <br />
                                    (REPEAT CHORUS)<br />
                                    <br />
                                    6. The clerks inside the mall are rather rude<br />
                                    Retail queens with major attitude<br />
                                    If I’m broke I won’t take it too hard<br />
                                    Cause I’m a smart shopper with five (FIVE!) credit cards<br />
                                    <br />
                                    (REPEAT CHORUS)<br />
                                    <br />
                                    7. At the mall it’s never hot or cold<br />
                                    24 hours complete climate control<br />
                                    Escalators move from floor to floor<br />
                                    I ride them all day long and don’t get bored<br />
                                    <br />
                                    (REPEAT CHORUS)<br />
                                    <br />
                                    8. When I’m hungry the mall is where I pick<br />
                                    To eat the food at Hot Dog On A Stick<br />
                                    Folks might say the mall is kind of bland<br />
                                    But the food court has fast food from many lands<br />
                                    (I cruise the bathrooms:)<br />
                                    <br />
                                    (REPEAT CHORUS)<br />
                                    <br />
                                    9. In the men’s room you’ll find glory holes<br />
                                    But be careful of the hairy trolls<br />
                                    Free sex at the mall can be so rad<br />
                                    One time I sucked off my best friend’s dad<br />
                                    <br />
                                    (REPEAT CHORUS)<br />
                                    <br />
                                    10. At the mall it’s always safe at night<br />
                                    Flourescent lights forever burning bright<br />
                                    It’s so well-lit I know I won’t get robbed<br />
                                    My dream is that someday I’ll get a job ….at!<br />
                                    <br />
                                    (REPEAT CHORUS)<br />
                                    <br />
                                    11. Every town as far as I can see<br />
                                    A Starbucks on every corner built for me<br />
                                    America is standing proud and tall<br />
                                    Cause now the whole goddamn country is a mall<br />
                                    <br />
                                    (REPEAT CHORUS) <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Lead vocals:<br />
                                    Jon sings verses 1,4, 7, 10. Chris sings 2, 5, 8.<br />
                                    Patrick sings 3, 9.  Luis sings 6, 11.<br />
