                                    Woke up with a morning woody<br />
                                    Could not keep my hands off my goodies<br />
                                    Alone in bed another day<br />
                                    I guess that’s the price you pay<br />
                                    ‘Cause late is when the bars get hopping<br />
                                    By them I’m tired out and dropping<br />
                                    Want a guy on the horizon<br />
                                    When the sun comes up, that’s when I’m rising<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Horny, horny in the morning<br />
                                    I’m crashed out in the evening fading<br />
                                    Wake up in the morning raging<br />
                                    Horny, horny in the morning<br />
                                    I’m horny in the morning<br />
                                    And my nerves are nearly gone<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Woke up with a morning woody<br />
                                    But no one’s here to share the goodies<br />
                                    Morning dick is so enticing<br />
                                    I’ll eat the pastry but not the icing<br />
                                    Want go to work refreshed<br />
                                    Instead I’m stifled and repressed<br />
                                    Want someone to do me right<br />
                                    To do me in the morning light<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Horny, horny in the morning<br />
                                    I’m crashed out in the evening fading<br />
                                    Wake up in the morning raging<br />
                                    Horny, horny in the morning<br />
                                    My libido’s like King Kong<br />
                                    But I’ve been solo for so long<br />
                                    I’m horny in the morning<br />
                                    And my nerves are nearly gone<br />
                                    I’m horny in the morning<br />
                                    And my nerves are nearly gone<br />
                                    I’m horny in the morning<br />
                                    And my nerves are nearly gone<br />

                                    I’ll do you sexual favors<br />
                                    But I’m not into those sexual flavors<br />
                                    Sometimes I wish I was braver<br />
                                    I’m vanilla, I’m vanilla<br />
                                    <br />
                                    I know about ropes and whips<br />
                                    Handcuffs and nipple clips<br />
                                    That’s something I’m gonna skip<br />
                                    I’m vanilla, I’m vanilla<br />
                                    <br />
                                    If I really get into you<br />
                                    Maybe I’ll sing a different tune<br />
                                    But I’m timid, I’m telling you<br />
                                    I’m vanilla, I’m vanilla, I’m vanilla<br />
                                    <br />
                                    People should do in bed<br />
                                    Whatever pops into their heads<br />
                                    But talk to me before planning ahead<br />
                                    It’s gotta be mutual<br />
                                    It’s gotta be mutual<br />
                                    <br />
                                    So you’re into discipline<br />
                                    It turns you on the more I sting<br />
                                    You’re liberal, but fantasize right-wing<br />
                                    I’m vanilla, I’m vanilla<br />
                                    <br />
                                    You’d like some skinhead boy<br />
                                    To be your bootlickin’ bedroom toy<br />
                                    That’s fine if it brings you joy<br />
                                    I’m vanilla, I’m vanilla<br />
                                    <br />
                                    I’m happy to fantasize<br />
                                    Do whatever might arise<br />
                                    But even though I like surprises<br />
                                    I’m vanilla, I’m vanilla, I’m vanilla<br />
                                    <br />
                                    You know I’ll never be<br />
                                    As kinky as you want me to be<br />
                                    If that’s not enough variety<br />
                                    Tie someone else to your bedpost<br />
                                    To your bedpost<br />
                                    <br />
                                    I’ll do you sexual favors<br />

                                        Well I heard you’re getting married<br />
                                        It seemed inevitable to me<br />
                                        Cause I was with you the night you met her<br />
                                        She had you hooked instantly<br />
                                        At the very first I thought it wouldn’t last too long<br />
                                        Pretty soon I realized that estimate was wrong<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Well I guess it’s kinda late now<br />
                                        To say what you already knew<br />
                                        I really wanted you<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I know it’s a jealous reaction<br />
                                        But after all that time we spent<br />
                                        She just picked you up and carried you off<br />
                                        I couldn’t follow where you went<br />
                                        I’m well aware that certain things just cannot be<br />
                                        But don’t deny that there were other possibilities<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Well I guess it’s kinda late now<br />
                                        To say what you already knew<br />
                                        I really wanted you<br />
                                        <br />
                                        On the hottest night of the summer<br />
                                        On a sticky, steamy street<br />
                                        I was glowing like the sunset<br />
                                        I knew how happy we could really be<br />
                                        Your suntanned body stretched out on the carpet in front of me<br />
                                        I know as long as I live I’ll never lose that memory<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Well I guess I shouldn’t say no more<br />
                                        You can do what you want to do<br />
                                        I just had to say I really wanted you<br />
                                        I really wanted you, I really wanted you<br />

                                DICK OF DEATH (Freeman)

                                        When I met him he was nice enough<br />
                                        For a short guy trying to act real tough in a bar<br />
                                        That kind of attitude won’t get you very far<br />
                                        His shirt was open and I saw his chest<br />
                                        A salt & pepper kind of furry mess, oh god<br />
                                        You know how that turns me on<br />
                                        Then he took my hand and ran it over<br />
                                        The outline in his pants<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He had the dick of death, he had the dick of death,<br />
                                        And so I closed my eyes and tried to fantasize<br />
                                        About his dick of death<br />
                                        <br />
                                        We grabbed a cab and went away to my place<br />
                                        We dropped our clothes so fast you’d think we were racing<br />
                                        I couldn’t wait to see it for myself<br />
                                        There it was staring up at me<br />
                                        Long and perfect, boy was I ever lucky, yeah<br />
                                        He kissed me and we fell down on the bed<br />
                                        Then he took my hand<br />
                                        And let me guide him into my promised land<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He had the dick of death, he had the dick of death,<br />
                                        I looked into his eyes and let him sodomize me<br />
                                        With his dick of death<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I’d never seen one quite that big before<br />
                                        When he’s soft he’s nearly hung down to the floor<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He had the dick of death, he had the dick of death,<br />
                                        I don’t know if I love him, but I love his dick of death<br />
                                        I don’t know if I love him, but I love his<br />
                                        I don’t know if I love him, but I love his<br />
                                        I don’t know if I love him, but I love his dick of death<br />
                                        I love his dick of death!<br />

                                        Working in that big department store<br />
                                        Wishing we could spend our days outside<br />
                                        Taking our breaks at the same time<br />
                                        It felt like more than friendship was on the line<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Talking for hours upon end<br />
                                        I was someone you could relate to<br />
                                        Daily you were dropping king size clues<br />
                                        You had me going, I was going hard for you<br />

                                        Flirting till I could not resist<br />
                                        I made the move I’d so long wanted to<br />
                                        But finally, you were just a tease<br />
                                        You led me on but wouldn’t fallow through<br />

                                        Broke it off with him<br />
                                        His features were so striking<br />
                                        Long lashes, dark brown curls<br />
                                        But I wish I’d taken pictures<br />

                                        Met a lovely goth boy<br />
                                        Way into 4AD<br />
                                        Precious, frail and sensitive<br />
                                        Took himself too seriously<br />
                                        Always lighting candles<br />
                                        Made his bed an altar<br />
                                        But I wish I’d taken pictures<br />
                                        Because our thing quickly faltered<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Finally bought a camera<br />
                                        After years of delay<br />
                                        Thought memory would be enough<br />
                                        But I found out too late<br />
                                        So let’s be realistic<br />
                                        The odds are this won’t last<br />
                                        Now I’m taking pictures<br />

                                        Why be selfish, why not share?<br />

                                        A strong identity<br />

                                        But you’ll settle for me<br />
                                        I love you with a heart so pure<br />
                                        But if you think I’ll be waiting<br />

                                        Kevin’s mysterious and enigmatic<br />
                                        Kevin is tall and darkly attractive<br />
                                        Kevin’s the subject of speculation<br />
                                        ‘Cause Kevin avoids any explanation<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Kevin’s a bachelor, never dated<br />
                                        He’s had a dozen offers he’s never taken<br />
                                        Kevin is friendly but can be remote<br />
                                        Avoids getting personal or too close<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Women want to know<br />
                                        Who’s that handsome man?<br />
                                        Men ask their acquaintances<br />
                                        About that lad<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Kevin’s inhibited, Kevin’s quiet<br />
                                        Intimacy seems to make him frightened<br />
                                        He was seen kissing a woman once<br />
                                        At a party when he was totally drunk<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Kevin’s got friends he could confide in<br />
                                        But he’s always denied them<br />
                                        The simple facts, avoids revelations<br />
                                        Kevin’s a master of evasion<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Lives all alone, rarely goes out<br />
                                        Is there a double life we don’t know about?<br />
                                        He won’t say that he’s gay<br />
                                        He won’t say that he’s not<br />
                                        He won’t say that he’s bi<br />
                                        He won’t be pinned down<br />
                                        He’ll say that he’s picky<br />
                                        And refuse to be labeled<br />
                                        Then the changes the subject<br />
                                        As soon as he’s able<br />
                                        His friends all see it as a matter of trust<br />
                                        They’d never judge him on his lust<br />
                                        They just wish he’d be more open<br />
                                        They’re tired and resentful of his withholding<br />
                                        <br />
                                        We’re all in the dark<br />
                                        Because Kevin won’t talk<br />
                                        We’re all in the dark<br />
                                        Because Kevin won’t talk<br />
                                        We’re all in the dark<br />
                                        Because Kevin won’t talk<br />
                                        But maybe Kevin’s more confused than we are<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Kevin, Kevin, Kevin…<br />

                                        But a gnawing feeling leaves you quite unsure<br />
                                        Out of the race, off the market, for ages now<br />
                                        Diving back in rekindles buried doubts<br />
                                        You thought time would help to make things clear<br />
                                        But after all this time, the ache won’t disappear<br />

                                        Found yourself in love, lost without a map<br />
                                        Falling back on that ingrained romantic crap<br />
                                        Time’s an investment, but after all you’ve spent<br />
                                        So many questions won’t let you be content<br />
                                        You’re wondering now if you’ve made a mistake<br />
                                        When your big romance just leaves you with an empty ache<br />

                                        You’re feeling stale, like a stalemate, with each embrace<br />
                                        From the back of your mind, to staring you in the face<br />
                                        Restlessness, oh yes, but more profound<br />
                                        Ship isn’t sinking, oh no, it’s run aground<br />
                                        Your relationship is hollow at the core<br />
                                        What the hell do you stay together for?<br />
                                        When you finally admit<br />
                                        That the love of your life is a farce<br />

                                    <br />
                                    Don’t want to go home alone<br />
                                    But how low will you go?<br />
                                    The cream is gone, the dregs prevail<br />
                                    Tough choices at the sidewalk sale<br />
                                    <br />
                                    That guy’s really not that bad<br />
                                    But if it was earlier, it’d be kinda sad<br />
                                    Make your move, don’t delay<br />
                                    Gotta be quick at the sidewalk sale<br />
                                    <br />
                                    That guy’s giving you a sexy look<br />
                                    Be better off curled up with a book<br />
                                    He’s gettin’ fresh, but looking stale<br />
                                    Slim pickings at the sidewalk sale<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Don’t want to go home alone<br />
                                    But how low will you go?<br />
                                    Self-respect is about to fail<br />
                                    Feeling pathetic at the sidewalk sale<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Looking for someone you’ll never forget<br />
                                    More likely find someone you’ll regret<br />
                                    Think it’s time to hit the trail<br />
                                    Gonna pass on the sidewalk sale<br />
