                                    And dumped the Lord<br />
                                    And now I know for sure<br />

                                        And it’s not like he’s unaware<br />
                                        But he plays hockey so he don’t care<br />
                                        Now I’m stuck with a boy with hockey hair<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He’s a wicked lover<br />
                                        He fills me with delight<br />
                                        He’ll turn a bedroom hat trick<br />
                                        Three times in one night<br />
                                        <br />
                                        But he won’t change his hairstyle<br />
                                        No matter how I try<br />
                                        Though I know he loves me<br />
                                        His first love is the ice<br />
                                        I’d love to sit him in a barber chair<br />
                                        But know I don’t have a prayer<br />
                                        Cause he plays hockey so he don’t care<br />
                                        Now I’m stuck with a boy with hockey hair<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I don’t tell him what clothes to wear<br />
                                        I’d simply rather see him bar<br />
                                        But he plays hockey so he don’t car<br />
                                        Now I’m stuck with a boy with hockey hair<br />

                                        I saw him at Guitar Center<br />
                                        He didn’t seem like a ten-percenter<br />
                                        He was picking up picks and strings<br />
                                        I was into picking up other things<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He was a hesher, a hairshaker<br />
                                        He looked to me like a mattress breaker<br />
                                        When he followed me out of the store<br />
                                        I knew he wanted more more more!<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He’s my headbanger boy<br />
                                        My heavy metal toy<br />
                                        With a haircut like a girl<br />
                                        He’s got me in a whirl<br />
                                        Headbanger<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He turned on his CD player<br />
                                        Did I prefer Metallica or Slayer?<br />
                                        I said “Whatever will get you hot”<br />
                                        By the second song our clothes were off<br />
                                        <br />
                                        His fat boner bobbing up and down<br />
                                        Playing air guitar as he danced around<br />
                                        He pounced on me and said “Let’s do it”<br />
                                        He knew what he wanted when we got down to it<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He’s my headbanger boy<br />

                                        With his studs and leather bands<br />
                                        He’s got me in his hands<br />
                                        Headbanger<br />

                                        I can’t believe I’m his first ever guy<br />
                                        The way he left me drained and dry<br />
                                        Then he led me to the door<br />
                                        His girlfriend was coming home at 4<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He’s my headbanger boy<br />

                                        He wants to see me again<br />
                                        When his girlfriend leaves at 10<br />

                                        But I need bigger muscles and bigger pecs<br />
                                        To compete with the younger guys coming up next<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I’m tired of wearing clothes from five years ago<br />
                                        And anything cheap I don’t want to know<br />
                                        Modeling’s gotta be the life for me<br />
                                        To get all the clothes that I deserve for free<br />

                                        I spent hours making the sauce<br />
                                        Bought the wine, didn’t care what it costs<br />
                                        It’s gonna be a special date<br />
                                        A day to celebrate<br />
                                        But I think I’d have more fun<br />
                                        If I was cooking for more than one<br />

                                        Another day to feel forgotten<br />
                                        Another occasion to make you feel rotten<br />

                                        But I’m alone in my double bed<br />
                                        I deserve a consolation award<br />

                                        Are sentimental, tacky and crude<br />
                                        I don’t want flowers anyway<br />
                                        I just want a guy who’ll stay<br />
                                        When you’re a failure at the chase<br />
                                        No prize for the second runner-up<br />
                                        I want to drink champagne from the winner’s cup <br />

                                        Taking our breaks at the same time<br />

                                        There’s a house on my street<br />
                                        And it looks real neat<br />
                                        It’s the place that I call home<br />
                                        There’s a tree by the sidewalk<br />
                                        nd a brand new car by the door<br />
                                        Just slammed the door on my hand, ow! Well I just burned the scrambled eggs<br />
                                        The dog just humped my leg<br />

                                        I don’t know what’s wrong with me<br />

                                        He flips his cigarette with disdain<br />

                                        He reads all the latest magazines<br />
                                        He’s quick to fallow, but thinks he’s in the lead<br />

                                        He’s popular in a scene<br />
                                        Where being nice is a radical act<br />

                                        Spent half his life in a bar<br />
                                        Now he looks so haggard<br />
                                        No sympathy for a braggart<br />

                            I’ve never been in anything like this before<br />
                            We take off our clothes before we’re in the door<br />
                            Eight hours of work is especially tough<br />
                            When three times a day is barely enough<br />
                            <br />
                            I got the carrot, you got the stick<br />
                            You start to nibble, I start to lick<br />
                            And we get our bodies all hot and sweaty and runny<br />
                            And then we fuck like bunnies<br />
                            <br />
                            Showing up early catches me off guard<br />
                            Hearing your knock on y door gets me hard<br />
                            You drive me rough like a pick-up truck<br />
                            It’s a never-ending, non-stop boy fuck<br />
                            <br />
                            I got the carrot, you got the stick<br />
                            You start to nibble, I start to lick<br />
                            And we get our bodies all hot and sweaty and runny<br />
                            And then we fuck like bunnies<br />
                            <br />
                            It’s been days and days since I’ve seen my friends<br />
                            Burning the candle with you at both ends<br />
                            We might burn out like a supernova<br />
                            But for the moment please roll over<br />
                            <br />

                    I met a cute guy in a gallery<br />
                    I looked at him he smiled at me<br />
                    We started talking and I was impressed<br />
                    He was smart and sweet and confident<br />
                    Just as I was thanking my good luck<br />
                    That was the moment reality struck<br />
                    He bid me goodbye and quickly fled<br />
                    Back to the safety of his girlfriend <br />
                    
                    And that’s the story so far<br />
                    That’s the story so far <br />
                    <br />
                    Well I was hangin’ out at that old queer bar<br />
                    The only in my home town<br />
                    Looking around, didn’t find much to choose<br />
                    Feeling the I-can’t-get-laid blues<br />
                    But as I was leaving the doorman smiled<br />
                    He was a honey so I stopped for a while<br />
                    We hit it off, but oh, cruel fate <br />
                    He was the only guy in the place that was straight <br />
                    <br />
                    And that’s the story so far<br />
                    That’s the story so far <br />
                    <br />
                    This is the part that I can’t stand<br />
                    Falling for an attractive man<br />
                    Who’s great but often straight<br />
                    This is the part I hate<br />
                    But one I ten still means a lot of them<br />
                    But so many are wrapped up in silly trends<br />
                    That I despise and make me roll my eyes<br />
                    Is this my community?<br />
                    Sometimes I want to mutiny <br />
                    <br />
                    Walking down the street<br />
                    So many guys I want to meet<br />
                    And it makes me smile<br />
                    But it might take a long while<br />
                    To find that cutie<br />
                    With both brains and beauty<br />
                    So I’ll keep the faith<br />
                    But for now I wait <br />
                    <br />
                    And that’s the story, that’s the story, that’s the story of my life<br />
                    That’s the story, that’s the story, that’s the story of my life<br />
                    That’s the story, that’s the story, that’s the story so far<br />
