                                    When I have you on my mind<br />
                                    I’m always lying on my back<br />
                                    But when we get together<br />
                                    I’m unhappy in the sack<br />
                                    Cause all my desires<br />
                                    And wild anticipation<br />
                                    Seems to wilt away<br />
                                    In continual frustration<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Cause if you want to be serviced with a smile<br />
                                    You gotta reciprocate<br />
                                    More than every once in a while<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Cause all work and no joy<br />
                                    Means I’ll be looking for another boy<br />
                                    All work and no joy<br />
                                    Means I’ll be going down on a different boy<br />
                                    Reciprocate, reciprocate<br />
                                    Unless you’d rather go home and masturbate<br />
                                    Reciprocate, reciprocate<br />
                                    <br />
                                    At the dinner table<br />
                                    You were vegetarian<br />
                                    But you smiled and said that you became<br />
                                    A carnivore in bed<br />
                                    But the evidence I’ve seen<br />
                                    Does nothing to support that claim<br />
                                    All the effort’s so one-sided<br />
                                    And that’s totally lame<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Cause if you want to be serviced with a smile<br />
                                    You gotta reciprocate<br />

                                    All work and no joy<br />

                                    You’re wearing it to the left today<br />
                                    Sweat pants clinging to your crevice<br />

                                    Jockstrap showing off your cheeks<br />
                                    Moving in for a closer peek<br />
                                    Running shorts thin as paper<br />
                                    Barely dressed, nearly naked<br />
                                    Pulled down around your ankles<br />
                                    I’ll make you spill out like an oil tanker<br />
                                    All because of your<br />

                                    Stretched tight, so hot<br />
                                    I’ve come, I’ve shot<br />
                                    My turn now to get you off<br />
                                    What a collection of skivvies I’ve got<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Skimpy little g-string<br />
                                    Hardly a stitch covering that thing<br />
                                    Tucked into that little pouch<br />
                                    Straining hard to get out<br />
                                    Barely hold you once you get throbbing<br />
                                    Let my hands go fishing around in<br />
                                    Look what I found in your<br />

                                    What fine cakes, what fine batter<br />

                                        Crowded night, rock and roll bar<br />
                                        The band is playing loud with roaring guitars<br />
                                        The crowd is dancing madly, slamming in the pit<br />
                                        I’m rubbing shoulders with a guy<br />
                                        I’d love to rub more with<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I’m dancing gleefully at the edge of the fray<br />
                                        Here he comes again, in a ricochet my way<br />
                                        Bodies packed together in a tight fit<br />
                                        He swings his butt around and I’m grabbing it<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Going one on one<br />
                                        Guys won’t accept your touch<br />
                                        But they will gladly take it<br />
                                        When it’s anonymous<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He lingers long enough to feel my hand on his ass<br />
                                        I grabbed his dick a couple times as he bounced past<br />
                                        He keeps returning to the spot where I stand<br />
                                        I’m sure by now he knows that’s another guy’s hand<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Then he bumped into me and yanked my crotch real hard<br />
                                        As he danced away, I was so turned on<br />
                                        I tried to flirt with him before he left the club<br />
                                        He just looked blank at me, he didn’t want to know<br />
                                        <br />
                                        A guy had made him hot, but he would not admit<br />
                                        Face to face that he was getting off on it<br />
                                        To cop a feel, a sneaky kind of joy<br />

                                        I knew he was the one for me<br />
                                        Grey temples and a little paunch<br />

                                        For a little role play<br />

                                        Denny’s kind of a dorky fella<br />
                                        Denny’s dramatic, Denny’s dark,<br />
                                        He ain’t nothing like the restaurant<br />
                                        He’s got HIV+ tattooed in black<br />
                                        In 6-inch letters on his back<br />
                                        He said “I want them to see<br />
                                        What they’ve done to me”<br />
                                        Denny<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Denny’s reading The Decameron<br />
                                        About a plague that came before<br />
                                        ‘Cause Denny’s dying and Denny don’t like it<br />
                                        And Denny don’t dance no more<br />
                                        <br />
                                        He’s kinda New Age, but Denny’s not too smart<br />
                                        Trying to love himself<br />
                                        But doesn’t really know how<br />
                                        He’s got a heart tattoo with his own name in it<br />
                                        Trouble is, Denny doesn’t really get it<br />
                                        Self-esteem is just a dream for Denny<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Denny can be very funny<br />
                                        Says he wanted my asshole tattooed on his chin<br />
                                        But Denny’s very demanding<br />
                                        Cause Denny ain’t got long to live<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Denny did porno photos and films<br />
                                        Until his tattoos ruined his career<br />
                                        He stares at the video feeling dejected<br />
                                        Helplessly watching himself get infected<br />
                                        Denny’s got pneumocystis<br />
                                        And a new tattoo as well<br />
                                        Denny got a skull and crossbones<br />
                                        Smack in the middle of his forehead<br />
                                        Says “I want them to see<br />
                                        What they’ve done to me”<br />
                                        Denny<br />

                                        He never even stuck a finger up his butt<br />
                                        Just to see how it would feel<br />

                                        Once you get to know the feeling<br />
                                        You get so hot you could spray the ceiling<br />

                                        He was scared that it would hurt<br />
                                        So he practiced with a dildo<br />
                                        To see how that would work<br />
                                        <br />
                                        At first he was unsure<br />
                                        And then the breakthrough occurred<br />
                                        He felt freed and empowered<br />
                                        Now he’s ready to be deflowered<br />

                                    My best friend<br />
                                    Tired of hearing me moan<br />
                                    Said you gotta learn<br />
                                    To have more fun on your own<br />
                                    <br />
                                    A long string of guys<br />
                                    They just come and go<br />
                                    Time for self-reliance<br />
                                    Exploring on my own<br />
                                    <br />
                                    I need new ideas, brand new toys<br />
                                    So I won’t have depend on other boys<br />
                                    It’s a new day, it’s a new dawn<br />
                                    With new pleasures to turn me on<br />
                                    <br />
                                    To the video counter<br />
                                    To satisfy this need<br />
                                    “Laguna Cum Shots”<br />
                                    It what I took home with me<br />
                                    <br />
                                    18-year-old boys<br />
                                    In million dollar homes?!<br />
                                    Yeah, it got me off<br />
                                    But left me unmoved<br />
                                    <br />
                                    I need new ideas, brand new toys<br />
                                    For when I’m not with other boys<br />
                                    It’s a new day, it’s a new dawn<br />
                                    With new pleasures to turn me on<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Buying a dildo<br />
                                    So hard to decide<br />
                                    Extra long, extra thick, extra wide?<br />
                                    I’d rather have a partner<br />
                                    To get my thrills<br />
                                    But with or without<br />
                                    I’ve got needs to fill<br />
                                    <br />

                                And I look to the light<br />
                                And I might wonder right where you are<br />
                                I just want this to last<br />
                                Or my future is past and all gone<br />
