                                    Wish I could turn on my light
                                    And read my Village Voice
                                    But layin’ next to this beached whale
                                    I haven’t got the choice
                                    He looked good at the time
                                    I must have been out of my mind
                                    Now I can’t sleep
                                    I can’t sleep!
                                    
                                    Hoping for a wild night
                                    Of sexual gymnastics
                                    But he thought he was god’s gift
                                    Selfish and sarcastic
                                    I wanted to take him home
                                    And I got him so I shouldn’t groan
                                    But I can’t sleep
                                    I can’t sleep!
                                    
                                    Minutes pass like hours
                                    My eyes wide open
                                    Staring up at the ceiling
                                    Every paint crack memorized
                                    Think I’ll reset my alarm
                                    To go off extra early
                                    Wake him up and get him out
                                    Try to sleep until 8:30
                                    Being up all night’s alright
                                    If it’s filled with erotic delight
                                    But I can’t sleep
                                    I can’t sleep!

                                    With a mirror in your hand
                                    Lay down on your bed
                                    Throw your legs in the air
                                    And see what’s around the bend
                                    
                                    Take a good long look
                                    At a buried treasure
                                    There between your cheeks
                                    A hidden source of pleasure
                                    
                                    It’s an orifice for elimination
                                    It’s an orifice for exploration
                                    
                                    Ring of joy, ring of joy
                                    A new discovery to enjoy
                                    And girl or any boy
                                    Can exercise their ring of joy
                                    
                                    “Ooh, but it’s so dirty!”
                                    Well, not if you keep it clean
                                    Dicks have a good reputation
                                    Even though they’re used to pee
                                    
                                    Learn to relax those muscles
                                    With practice they’ll open wide
                                    Hit your pleasure center
                                    From the other side
                                    
                                    It’s an orifice for elimination
                                    It’s an orifice for stimulation
                                    
                                    Ring of joy, ring of joy
                                    A tight muscle to employ
                                    Any girl or any boy
                                    Can break on through that ring of joy
                                    
                                    Did I mention latex?
                                    ‘Cause you know it´s a must
                                    Gotta protect yourself
                                    Even with somebody you trust
                                    It’s a natural feeling
                                    Don’t let anyone tell you it’s not
                                    You don’t have to be queer
                                    But it helps a lot
                                    
                                    It’s an orifice for liberation
                                    It’s an orifice for celebration
                                    
                                    Ring of joy, ring of joy
                                    Erotic thrill, sexual toy
                                    A boy inside another boy
                                    Go all the way with your ring of joy

                                        The way his hair hangs down
                                        When he’s on top of me

                                        There’s many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas;
                                        There’s many a young boy who feels things he don’t comprehend.
                                        Well small town don’t like it when somebody falls between sexes,
                                        No, a small town don’t like it when a cowboy has feelings for men.
                                        
                                        Well I believe in my soul that inside every man there’s a feminine,
                                        And inside every lady there’s a deep manly voice loud and clear.
                                        Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he does with his women,
                                        But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer.
                                        
                                        Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other —
                                        What did you think all those saddles and boots was about?
                                        There’s many a cowboy who don’t understand the way that he feels towards his brother,
                                        Inside every cowboy there’s a lady who’d love to slip out.
                                        
                                        Ten men for each woman was the rule way back when on the prairie,
                                        And somehow those cowboys must have kept themselves warm late at night.
                                        Cowboys are famous for getting riled up about fairies,
                                        But I’ll tell you the reason a big strong man gets so uptight
                                        
                                        Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
                                        That’s why they wear leather, and Levi’s and belts buckled tight.
                                        There’s many a cowboy who don’t understand the way that he feels towards his brother;
                                        There’s many a cowboy who’s more like a lady at night.
                                        
                                        Well there’s always somebody who says what the others just whisper,
                                        And mostly that someone’s the first one to get shot down dead:
                                        When you talk to a cowboy don’t treat him like he was a sister
                                        Don’t mess with the lady that’s sleepin’ in each cowboy’s head.
                                        
                                        Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other —
                                        Even though they take speed and drive pickups and shoot their big guns;
                                        There’s many a cowboy who don’t understand the way that he feels towards his brother;
                                        There’s many a cowboy who keeps quiet about things he’s done.

                                        I get all wet between my legs

                                        Everytime I see your face

                                        And handsome and strong
                                        You can wear the uniform and I can play along
                                        
                                        And so it goes
                                        Go ’round again
                                        But now and then we wonder who the real men are

                                        They used to go on dates with girls
                                        But now they don’t pretend
                                        After trying to deny it
                                        They went ahead and tried it
                                        Couldn’t believe how excellent it felt
                                        
                                        It’s no bogus journey

                                        They’re practicing their guitar solos
                                        But in the bedroom
                                        They’re practicing on one another
                                        School was such a pain
                                        What a way to waste your brain

                                        But they’re not rubes
                                        They got each other by the pubes
                                        Squeezing on one another’s tubes
                                        One’s dark, one is blond
                                        Day an night they get it on
                                        They got condoms in their pockets
                                        Plug into each other’s sockets

                                        They may not be too bright
                                        But they know what they like
                                        A love affair most triumphant

                                        You start to take your clothes off

                                        And there’s so much I want to explore

                                        I’d like to take some time
                                        To let the mystery unfold
                                        Sometimes what’s hidden
                                        Is sexier than what is shown
                                        
                                        It’s nice to find a hard-on
                                        But sooner than I’d planned
                                        I’d rather start with a softy
                                        And feel you hardening in my hand
                                        
                                        I want to strip you down
                                        Slowly strip you down
                                        Totally strip you down
                                        
                                        For some guys sex is a formula
                                        It seems so calculated
                                        I would have had a lot more fun sometimes
                                        If I’d stayed home and masturbated
                                        
                                        A good lover discovers
                                        That patience gets rewarded
                                        In the rush to uncover
                                        So much goes unrecorded
                                        So don’t undress just yet

                                    It was double vision disorienting
                                    Denny’s kind of a dorky fella
                                    Denny’s dramatic, Denny’s dark,
                                    He ain’t nothing like the restaurant
                                    He’s got HIV+ tattooed in black
                                    In 6-inch letters on his back
                                    He said “I want them to see
                                    What they’ve done to me”

                                    Denny’s reading The Decameron
                                    About a plague that came before
                                    ‘Cause Denny’s dying and Denny don’t like it
                                    And Denny don’t dance no more
                                    
                                    He’s kinda New Age, but Denny’s not too smart
                                    Trying to love himself
                                    But doesn’t really know how
                                    He’s got a heart tattoo with his own name in it
                                    Trouble is, Denny doesn’t really get it
                                    Self-esteem is just a dream for Denny
                                    
                                    Denny can be very funny
                                    Says he wanted my asshole tattooed on his chin
                                    But Denny’s very demanding
                                    Cause Denny ain’t got long to live
                                    
                                    Denny did porno photos and films
                                    Until his tattoos ruined his career
                                    He stares at the video feeling dejected
                                    Helplessly watching himself get infected
                                    Denny’s got pneumocystis
                                    And a new tattoo as well
                                    Denny got a skull and crossbones
                                    Smack in the middle of his forehead
                                    Says “I want them to see

                                We’ll push the packages out of the way
                                And after you’ve unwrapped me,
                                Naked on the floor we’ll play
