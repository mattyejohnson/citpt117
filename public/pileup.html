                                    Wish I could turn on my light<br />
                                    And read my Village Voice<br />
                                    But layin’ next to this beached whale<br />
                                    I haven’t got the choice<br />
                                    He looked good at the time<br />
                                    I must have been out of my mind<br />
                                    Now I can’t sleep<br />
                                    I can’t sleep!<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Hoping for a wild night<br />
                                    Of sexual gymnastics<br />
                                    But he thought he was god’s gift<br />
                                    Selfish and sarcastic<br />
                                    I wanted to take him home<br />
                                    And I got him so I shouldn’t groan<br />
                                    But I can’t sleep<br />
                                    I can’t sleep!<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Minutes pass like hours<br />
                                    My eyes wide open<br />
                                    Staring up at the ceiling<br />
                                    Every paint crack memorized<br />
                                    Think I’ll reset my alarm<br />
                                    To go off extra early<br />
                                    Wake him up and get him out<br />
                                    Try to sleep until 8:30<br />
                                    Being up all night’s alright<br />
                                    If it’s filled with erotic delight<br />
                                    But I can’t sleep<br />

                                    Lay down on your bed<br />
                                    Throw your legs in the air<br />
                                    And see what’s around the bend<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Take a good long look<br />
                                    At a buried treasure<br />
                                    There between your cheeks<br />
                                    A hidden source of pleasure<br />

                                    It’s an orifice for elimination<br />

                                    Ring of joy, ring of joy<br />
                                    A new discovery to enjoy<br />
                                    And girl or any boy<br />
                                    Can exercise their ring of joy<br />

                                    “Ooh, but it’s so dirty!”<br />
                                    Well, not if you keep it clean<br />
                                    Dicks have a good reputation<br />
                                    Even though they’re used to pee<br />

                                    A tight muscle to employ<br />
                                    Any girl or any boy<br />
                                    Can break on through that ring of joy<br />
                                    <br />

                                    ‘Cause you know it´s a must<br />
                                    Gotta protect yourself<br />

                                    It’s a natural feeling<br />
                                    Don’t let anyone tell you it’s not<br />
                                    You don’t have to be queer<br />
                                    But it helps a lot<br />
                                    <br />
                                    It’s an orifice for liberation<br />
                                    It’s an orifice for celebration<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Ring of joy, ring of joy<br />
                                    Erotic thrill, sexual toy<br />
                                    A boy inside another boy<br />
                                    Go all the way with your ring of joy<br />

                                        The way his hair hangs down<br />
                                        When he’s on top of me<br />

                                        There’s many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas;<br />
                                        There’s many a young boy who feels things he don’t comprehend.<br />
                                        Well small town don’t like it when somebody falls between sexes,<br />
                                        No, a small town don’t like it when a cowboy has feelings for men.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Well I believe in my soul that inside every man there’s a feminine,<br />
                                        And inside every lady there’s a deep manly voice loud and clear.<br />
                                        Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he does with his women,<br />
                                        But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other —<br />
                                        What did you think all those saddles and boots was about?<br />
                                        There’s many a cowboy who don’t understand the way that he feels towards his brother,<br />
                                        Inside every cowboy there’s a lady who’d love to slip out.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Ten men for each woman was the rule way back when on the prairie,<br />
                                        And somehow those cowboys must have kept themselves warm late at night.<br />
                                        Cowboys are famous for getting riled up about fairies,<br />
                                        But I’ll tell you the reason a big strong man gets so uptight<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other<br />
                                        That’s why they wear leather, and Levi’s and belts buckled tight.<br />
                                        There’s many a cowboy who don’t understand the way that he feels towards his brother;<br />
                                        There’s many a cowboy who’s more like a lady at night.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Well there’s always somebody who says what the others just whisper,<br />
                                        And mostly that someone’s the first one to get shot down dead:<br />
                                        When you talk to a cowboy don’t treat him like he was a sister<br />
                                        Don’t mess with the lady that’s sleepin’ in each cowboy’s head.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other —<br />
                                        Even though they take speed and drive pickups and shoot their big guns;<br />
                                        There’s many a cowboy who don’t understand the way that he feels towards his brother;<br />

                                        <br />
                                        See the nice boys, dancing in pairs<br />
                                        Golden earring, golden tan, blow wave in their hair<br />
                                        Sure they’re all straight<br />
                                        Straight as a line<br />
                                        All the gays are macho,<br />
                                        Can’t you see the leather shine<br />
                                        You don’t wanna act dumb,<br />
                                        Don’t wanna offend<br />
                                        So don’t call me a faggot now unless you are a friend<br />
                                        Then if you’re tall<br />
                                        And handsome and strong<br />
                                        You can wear the uniform and I can play along<br />
                                        <br />

                                        They went ahead and tried it<br />

                                        They’re practicing their guitar solos<br />
                                        But in the bedroom<br />
                                        They’re practicing on one another<br />

                                        They got each other by the pubes<br />
                                        Squeezing on one another’s tubes<br />
                                        One’s dark, one is blond<br />
                                        Day an night they get it on<br />
                                        They got condoms in their pockets<br />

                                        Is sexier than what is shown<br />
                                        <br />
                                        It’s nice to find a hard-on<br />
                                        But sooner than I’d planned<br />
                                        I’d rather start with a softy<br />
                                        And feel you hardening in my hand<br />
                                        <br />
                                        I want to strip you down<br />
                                        Slowly strip you down<br />
                                        Totally strip you down<br />
                                        <br />
                                        For some guys sex is a formula<br />
                                        It seems so calculated<br />
                                        I would have had a lot more fun sometimes<br />
                                        If I’d stayed home and masturbated<br />
                                        <br />
                                        A good lover discovers<br />
                                        That patience gets rewarded<br />
                                        In the rush to uncover<br />
                                        So much goes unrecorded<br />
                                        So don’t undress just yet<br />
                                        This ain’t no race or contest<br />
                                        I want to know every inch<br />
                                        Before we finally get down to the bottom<br />
                                        <br />

                                    ‘Cause Denny’s dying and Denny don’t like it<br />
                                    And Denny don’t dance no more<br />
                                    <br />
                                    He’s kinda New Age, but Denny’s not too smart<br />
                                    Trying to love himself<br />
                                    But doesn’t really know how<br />
                                    He’s got a heart tattoo with his own name in it<br />
                                    Trouble is, Denny doesn’t really get it<br />
                                    Self-esteem is just a dream for Denny<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Denny can be very funny<br />
                                    Says he wanted my asshole tattooed on his chin<br />
                                    But Denny’s very demanding<br />
                                    Cause Denny ain’t got long to live<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Denny did porno photos and films<br />
                                    Until his tattoos ruined his career<br />
                                    He stares at the video feeling dejected<br />
                                    Helplessly watching himself get infected<br />
                                    Denny’s got pneumocystis<br />
                                    And a new tattoo as well<br />
                                    Denny got a skull and crossbones<br />
                                    Smack in the middle of his forehead<br />
                                    Says “I want them to see<br />
                                    What they’ve done to me”<br />
                                    Denny<br />

                                I’d love to puncture their balloons<br />
                                Spray silly string around their rooms<br />
                                The world’s a mess, but for awhile<br />
                                We lick and suck and feel fine<br />
                                I find it hard, that’s nice to find<br />
                                Forget the closet, never mind<br />
                                Hello, hello, hello, homo…<br />
